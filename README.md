<b>omg-js</b> is a playable, CTF like static web project develop with HTML, CSS & JS. This project creates under MPL-2.0. omg-js holds some basic javascript and web designing concept ideas for new developers. It's designed and developed for anyone who likes to learn basic web developing concepts in a new way. But Remember this repo doesn't provide/include any tutorial or like that. I'm sure omg-js will help with new conceptual thinking with fundamentals on WEB development and JavaScript.
